;;; Purpose:    Data packaging and access for Common Lisp Statistics.
;;;             This redoes data storage structures in a CLOS based
;;;             framework.
;;;

;;; What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
;;; 'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
;;; designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

(in-package :lisp-stat-data-clos)

;;; No real basis for work, there is a bit of new-ness and R-ness to
;;; this work. In particular, the notion of relation is key and
;;; integral to the analysis.  Tables are related and matched vectors,
;;; for example.  "column" vectors are related observations (by
;;; measure/recording) while "row" vectors are related readings (by
;;; case)
;;; 

;;; Relational structure -- can we capture a completely unnormalized
;;; data strucutre to propose possible modeling approaches, and
;;; propose appropriate models and inferential strategies?
;;; 
;;; So we want a verb-driven API for data collection construction.  We
;;; should encode independence or lack of, as possible.

;; Need to figure out typed vectors.   We then map a series of typed
;; vectors over to tables where columns are equal typed.  In a sense,
;; this is a relation (1-1) of equal-typed arrays.  For the most part,
;; this ends up making the R data.frame into a relational building
;; block (considering 1-1 mappings using row ID as a relation).  
;; Is this a worthwhile generalization?

;;; verbs vs semantics for DS conversion -- consider the possibily of
;;; how adverbs and verbs relate, where to put which semantically to
;;; allow for general approach.

;;; eg. Kasper's talk on the FUSION collection of parsers.

;;; 
;;; Need to consider modification APIs
;;; actions are:
;;; - import 
;;; - get/set row names (case names)
;;; -         column names (variable names)
;;; -         dataset values
;;; -         annotation/metadata
;;; -    make sure that we do coherency checking in the exported
;;; -    functions.
;;; -    ... 
;;; - reshapeData/reformat/reshapr a reformed version of the dataset (no
;;;           additional input). 
;;; -         either overwriting or not, i.e. with or without copy.
;;; - check consistency of resulting data with metadata and related
;;;           data information.
;;; -
