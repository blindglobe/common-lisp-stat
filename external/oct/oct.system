;; If you want all core functions to be inline (like the C++ code

;; Not sure we really want to inline everything, but the QD C++ code
;; inlines all of the functions so we do the same.  This makes CMUCL
;; take a very long time to compile the code, and the resulting
;; functions are huge.  (I think div-qd is 8 KB, and sqrt-qd is a
;; whopping 30 KB!)
