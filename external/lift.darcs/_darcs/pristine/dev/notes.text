(in-package lift)

I tried to be clever and abstract out the do-testing part from the run-tests
and run-test. The trouble is that this abstraction isn't right. I end up 
needing to wrap error catching at two levels (one at the outer level to handle
when multiple tests are happening and one on the inner run-test-internal 
level). The solution is probably a big refactoring that better models the
multi-test and single-test cases individually.

it's a failure when :expected-error doesn't error or :expected-problem
  doesn't fail

nicer reporting; espec for ensure-cases

turtle -> ntriples -> triple-store -> sparql query -> graphs
  
options for addtest
  expect-failure := string | t
  evaluate-when-defined := t | nil
  timeout 
  documentation

use command line arguments to specify suite, etc..

be nice to share message or special formmatting for ensures at 
  the testsuite level

dynamic-variable code gets added at every level of the hierarchy
  only need to add at for direct dynamic variables, not all
  - need direct-d-v i... actually, no. The dv are set where?
  I think everyone needs the code, look later

Where do options for a test case go? We could just add code to the
  test case method but this would make it hard to introspect.
  Could define a method on suite and case... or a regular ht.

Do a simple walk on the code to know which "line" of code failed so 
that you can report that. What about (let ...), we'd want to walk into
that. Special case? (let, let*, bind, mvb, db, progX, loop, dotimes, do, 
hm, quite a few (and I'm sure many more). 

Introspect the functions / forms a test tests

ensure-random-cases (etc) don't really play well with ensure-condition
  you get to know that the test failed but not how...

Lift needs an extra group of parentheses in :tests: e.g.:
  (deftestsuite twinql.section-data-sort-4 (twinql.section-data-sort)
    ()
    (:test
     ((query-sort-4)
      (ensure (null (filter-results))))))
Gross!
       
compile: lift doesn't catch errors during compile (e.g., symbol x is not 
exported). should it?

report: add consing and times to ouptu (optional)

:run-setup :once-per-session 
	   (give not implemented error at test def time, not run time
	   or implement it)

need tests that metadata is correctly set too

need to test that all variables in a hierarchy are initialized as appropriate

We're not checking for class existence in addtest... 
  leads to weird seeming errors

LIFT: handle macros better
LIFT: code walker -- even a simple one that just tree searched for macros
  some FP are OK

(list lift::*test-is-being-compiled?*
      lift::*test-is-being-defined?*
      lift::*test-is-being-executed?*
      lift::*test-is-being-loaded?*)

(setf lift::*test-is-being-compiled?* nil
      lift::*test-is-being-defined?* nil
      lift::*test-is-being-executed?* nil
      lift::*test-is-being-loaded?* nil)

may need to change teardownn-test to standard method combination and 
 use :after. See
(defmethod teardown-test :before ((test-suite test-mixin))
  (setf (current-step test-suite) 'teardown-test))

randomly change order of tests

(deftestsuite test-addition ()
  (a b)
  (:cases (:map (a '(1 2 3 4 5))
                (b '(9 8 7 6 5))))
  (:test ((ensure-same (+ a b) 10 :test '=))))

(deftestsuite test-addition ()
  (a b)
  (:cases (a '(1 2 3 4 5))
          (b '(9 8 7 6 5)))
  (:test ((ensure-same (+ a b) (+ b a) :test '=))))

ok 1. Handle simple cases clause -> initialize-prototypes
ok 2. Handle run-time evaluation / creation of prototypes
  fool with containers
ok 3. Look at quickcheck and think a bit
4. Determine what a paper on this might look like.

make-test-result seems a bit silly too

;;?? Clearly a WIP
(defun testing-interactively-p ()

  (and *test-is-being-defined?*
       (not (or *test-is-being-compiled?*
                *test-is-being-loaded?*))))

test-suite-p, etc could be defined more cleanly if the class
  one was 'definitive'

Instead of class properties, use the MOP

new manual

If you define a test suite and a test and then redefine the test-suite, 
  and then try to (run-test), you'll get an error. Should give a nice message

~ need set of lift meta tests and set of lift "UI" tests

save running times??
pending and run-pending method

more introspection
  finding suites and tests

sharing setup / teardown
  accumulating tests

~ - non-deterministic
  e.g., checking for a socket, expect failure occasionally

load testing

testing the test
  donÕt continue when failure option

cache previous results and only rerun failed tests

stochastic tests

non-determininistic tests

[doc] ensure's should have a documentation clause

simplify test-suite-p

need a better error message for when a superclass that DNE or is not a test-class
  is used.

?should use same tricks as define-debugging-class to mangle the name

shouldn't teardown-test be an :after

when using break-on-errors? you should have restarts to allow to cancel out
  completely, or keep going with the next test or whatever

when defining a test with addtest, if no current test case, or if named
  case doesnt't exist, offer to create it (use a restart or whatever like in debug).

remove-test should print a nicer message if the test you're trying to undef DNE

remove-test needs to clean up data tables too

with-test should take optional test-class

clean up all the tables and stuff

with-test needs error handling

add documentation (at the least to the public interface)

Capture errors and have various fun restarts

error check addtest if class dne or not test-mixin

Improve error messages

;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simplest case may be to give test-mixin a slot to hold initial values.
For 'regular' tests, this is what it is. For more complex tests, the values
are lists (need to differentiate between lists and multiple prototypes).

Then all tests work the same way. 

The questions for the protocol are standard iteration quesionts: what is
the next value? and are we done yet?



ok - Probably don't need to define accessors or initargs since we're using test-environment
ok - I don't think we need *test-result* -- it's not used
  I think it's a holdover from JUnit
ok - use test-code table to prevent some duplication (or require names)
ok - when name supplied, don't add "test-" to it
ok - get rid of print-test-result {s} and make better use of print-object and describe-object
ok - When adding multiple tests, need to store their names immediately (i.e.,
  before going on to parse the next test).
obsolete - Improve error/warning for duplicate code/names
ok - run-tests works OK; run-test semi; evaluating an addtest does not
ok - need to store more in the test results to see what values were used, etc.
ok - Screw run-test being a macro
ok - Map case keywords to functions (think of tapir). Each of :map, :cross, etc. 
  is handled separately. This will make it easy to extend and build big monsters
  Only "hard" part is correctly combining the conses.
ok - This prototype stuff at compile time is hard... maybe it would be easier to do it
  at run time (using stack / CPL to help...)
ok - The problem with not using slots of the test class is that I need to duplicate
  a bunch of functionality like inherited slots to make with-test-slots work
ok - I don't think I'm using *test-do-children?*, etc. correctly either
ok - Note: LIFT does not use the slots of the instance of the test-class; all looks 
  are via test-environment-value
  (I no longer remember why this was a good idea)
  (maybe don't even need the slots... just the defs)
ok - Get (deftestsuite test-addition ()
      (a b)
      (:cases (:map (a '(1 2 3 4 5))
                    (b '(9 8 7 6 5))))
      (:test ((ensure-same (+ a b) 10 :test '=))))
To work... Standardize-Cases-Form is broken
ok - parse-test-name-and-class is probably wacked b/c I changed to *current-suite-class-name*
  removed
ok - Use multiple processes to handle run away tests
  get reporting to work correctly
ok - the whole number of tests thing is stupid and wacky
something wrong with loading or compiling addtest, the numbers don't get
  incremented properly.
  testsuite-test-count, number-of-tests
  change to getting count at start of deftestsuite and then add 1 to a special 
  for each
no - use dynamic scope for *test-is-being-compiled?* rather than unwind-protect
ok - LIFT: better control of printing (:follow-print)
ok - LIFT: variable to control behavior on warning / failure: print full report, etc.
ok - add :function to define local functions, use rewriting and macrolet 
yes - so how do we integrate measuring with the report -- change the test result
  add test result properties
