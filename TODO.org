* Intro and Metadata

File:       TODO.lisp
Author:     AJ Rossini <blindglobe@gmail.com>
Copyright:  (c) 2007-2010, AJ Rossini <blindglobe@gmail.com>.  BSD.
Purpose:    Stuff that needs to be made working sits inside the
            Task sections.

            This file contains the current challenges to solve,
            including a description of the setup and the work to
            solve.  Solutions welcome.

What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

* Design Documentation

This section provides some of the details regarding infrastructure of
the system, as a means of including TODO statements.

** (Internal) Package and (External) System Hierarchy

*** Singletons (primary building blocks)
    
    These are packages as well as

    | xarray        | common access structure to array-like         |

    | lisp-matrix     | general purpose matrix package, linking to lapack |      |
    |                 | for numerics. Depends on:                         |      |

    | cls-dataframe   | in the same spirit as lisp-matrix, a means to     |      |
    |                 | create tables.  Perhaps better called datatables? |      |
    | cls-probability | depends on gsll, cl-variates, cl-? initially,     |      |

*** Need to integrate

**** Random number streams and probability calculus


     Something for random numbers, that has a settable seed.  However,
     we could pass on the "right thing" in favor of something that
     will "work for now".  
     cl-randist

**** import of data in text files

     CSV and similar specialized imports

     rsm-string

**** Graphics

     ?? cl-2d  : 
       	       cl-cairo2 : cffi

     ?? cl-plplot : cffi


* Tasks to Do [2/26]

  Usually, we need to load it everything before going on.

#+name: loadit
#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :cls)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: loadit
| :CLS |

  and sometimes we might want to recompile fully:

#+name: recompile-it-all
#+begin_src lisp
  (asdf:oos 'asdf:compile-op :cls :force T)
#+end_src

  Currently QuickLisp support doesn't provide a recompilation
  facility.  And QL is built over and partially extends ASDF, so we
  should be fine for now. 

** DONE [#B] SET UP
   - State "DONE"       from "CURR"       [2010-10-12 Tue 13:48] \\
     setup is mostly complete
   - State "CURR"       from "TODO"       [2010-10-12 Tue 13:47]
   - State "TODO"       from ""           [2010-10-12 Tue 13:47]

   This is an example of a custom setup, not really interesting at
   this point (it's obsolete) except to remind Tony how to program.
   Pointy-headed managers need any support they can find in order to
   regress to their hacker-childhood.

   The only point of this section is to illustrate that we could want
   to load additional modules that are not a central part of the core
   files.

** CURR [#A] Integrate with quicklist support.
   
   important to merge with quicklisp system loader support.  We
   currently have some of this work integrated, but I think there are
   a few systems which are not auto-installable.


** CURR [#A] Testing: unit, regression, examples. [0/3]

   Testing consists of unit tests, which internally verify subsets of
   code, regression tests, and functional tests (in increasing order
   of scale).
*** CURR [#B] Unit tests

   Unit tests have been started using LIFT.  Need to consider some of
   the other systems that provide testing, when people add them to the
   mix of libraries that we need, along with examples of how to use.

installation qualification (IQ) and performance qualification (PQ)

    CL-VARIATES is a system developed by Gary W King.  It uses streams
    with seeds, and is hence reproducible.  (Random comment: why do CL
    programmers as a class ignore computational reproducibility?)

    The main problem with this system is licensing.  It has a weird
    licensing schema which prevents

     What we want to do here is describe the basic available API that
     is present.  So while the previous work describes what the basic
     reproducibility approach would be in terms of generating lists of
     reproducible pRNG streams, we need the full range of possible
     probability laws that are present. 

     One of the good things about cl-variates is that it provides for
     reproducibility.  One of the bad things is that it has a mixed
     bag for an API.

    Problems:
    1. no seed setting for random numbers
    2. contamination of a probability support with optimization and
       linear algebra.

    Positives:
    1. good code
    2. nice design for generics.

** TODO [#B] Documentation and Examples [0/3]
   - State "TODO"       from ""           [2010-10-14 Thu 00:12]

   I've started putting examples of use in function documentation.  If
   you are a lisp'er, you'll find this pendantic and insulting.  Many
   of the uses are trivial.  However, this has been tested out on a
   number of research statisticians (the primary user audience) and
   found useful.

   Still need to write the 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (evaluate-documentation-example 'function-name)
#+END_SRC

   function, which would print out the example and run it live.
   Hopefully with the same results.  Need to setup the infrastructure,
   but basically, we'd like something like:

#+name: Example-InLineDoc
#+begin_src lisp
  (cls-example-progn
      (example-code-for-function-1)
      (example-code-for-function-...)
      (example-code-for-function-n))
#+end_src

   and have this within the doc-string.  Then the doc-string would be
   parsed for the appropriate code and we'd get the results, evaluated
   in a special name space derived from the object (function, class)
   name, possibly with the corresponding functions and environment
   set up that would be required.  OR, it could just work in cl-user
   (which is the default starting location.

   Here are some possible common lisp systems that could be
   evaluated:

* Proposals
  Place proposals for features, work, etc here...
** <2011-12-29 Thu> new stuff
   First new proposal is to track proposals.

* Rejoinder

  This project is dedicated to all the lisp hackers out there who
  provided the basic infrastructure to get so far so fast with minimal
  effort on my part.

  And to all the people trying to help to get this off the ground.
