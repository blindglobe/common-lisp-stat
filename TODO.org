Copyright:  (c) 2007-2010, AJ Rossini <blindglobe@gmail.com>.  BSD.
Purpose:    Stuff that needs to be made working sits inside the
            Task sections.

            This file contains the current challenges to solve,
            including a description of the setup and the work to
            solve.  Solutions welcome.

What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
'releases'.  Our software 'escapes', leaving a bloody trail of
designers and quality assurance people in its wake.

* Design

** (Internal) Package and (External) System Hierarchy
*** Singletons (primary building blocks)
    
    These are packages as well as 

    | asdf          | common system loader                          |
    | xarray        | common access structure to array-like         |
    |               | (matrix, vector) structures.                  |
    | cls-config    | initialization of Lisp state, variables, etc, |
    |               | localization to the particular lisp.          |
    | lift          | unit-testing                                  |
    | cffi          | foriegn function library                      |
    | alexandria    |                                               |
    | babel         |                                               |
    | iterate       |                                               |
    | metabang-bind |                                               |

*** Dependency structure

    | lisp-matrix     | general purpose matrix package, linking to lapack |      |
    |                 | for numerics. Depends on:                         |      |
    |                 | ffa                                               | cffi |
    |                 | fnv                                               | cffi |
    |                 | cl-blapack                                        | cffi |
    |                 | xarray                                            |      |
    | cls-dataframe   | in the same spirit as lisp-matrix, a means to     |      |
    |                 | create tables.  Perhaps better called datatables? |      |
    | cls-probability | depends on gsll, cl-variates, cl-? initially,     |      |

*** Need to integrate

    The following needs to work, and a related syntax for resampling
    and similar synthetic data approaches (bootstrapping, imputation)
    ought to use similar syntax as well.

    ;; Syntax examples using lexical scope, closures, and bindings to

    ;; it is line-at-a-time that we are considering or if there is
    ;; another mapping strategy.  In particular, one could imagine a
    ;; looping-over-observations function, or a
    ;; looping-over-independent-observations function which leverages a
    ;; grouping variable which provides guidance for what is considered
    ;; independent from the sampling frame being considered. The frame
    ;; itself (definable via some form of metadata to clarify scope?)
    ;; could clearly provide a bit of relativity for clarifying what
    ;; statistical independence means.

For nonlinear structureal models, expand around RE=0

Cramer-Rao : MF^{-1} is lower bound for estimation variance.

Design comparisons: 

- smallest SE, but is a matrix, so
- criteria for matrix comparison
-- D-opt, (power (determinant MF) (/ 1 P))


find design maxing D opt, (power (determinant MF) (/ 1 P))
Design varialables 
 -- contin vars for smapling times within interval or set -- number of groups for cat vars

Stat in Med 2009, expansion around post-hoc RE est, not necessarily zero.

Example binary covariate C

(if (= i reference-class) 
    (setf (aref C i) 0)
    (setf (aref C i) 1))

PFIM provides for a given design and values of \beta: 
 compute extended FIM
 SE/RSE for \beta of each class of each covar
 eval influence of design on SE(\beta)

inter-occassion variability (IOV)
- patients sampled more than once, H occassions
- RE for IOV
- additional vars to estimate

;;; comparison criteria

functional of conc/time curve which is used for comparison, i.e. 
(AUC conc/time-curve)
(Cmax conc/time-curve)
(Tmax conc/time-curve)

*** Example of Integration with CL-GENOMIC

    CL-GENOMIC is a very interesting data-structure strategy for
    manipulating sequence data.
