;; We assume that the "loading-data.lisp" code has been run, and one

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; EVERYTHING BELOW IS BROKEN

;; This is a test philosophy for data analysis from an EDA
;; perspective.  It could be expanded to decision support and
;; inferential statistics, but currently is only intended to provide
;; statistically appropriate numerical and visual summaries that are
;; objects that can be manipulated to explore the effect of varying
;; data and metadata.

;; Summarize is the basic EDA tool -- it accepts symbols or lists of
;; symbols, to describe what, when, and how to do it.  The resulting
;; data structure has a means for re-invoking the result as well as
;; partial storage of key results (when appropriate) as well as
;; metadata about the results (time / context if provided).

;; numerical: (txt / *ml /  ,  variable / stream / spec'd to file)
;; visual: (static/dynamic, fixed/interactive) (need better term than fixed)

;; context -- using dataset metadata, to drive the resulting summary.
;; dataset metadata:
;; #1 sampling scheme -
;;       retro / prospect  collection
;;       random, biased, convenience sampling;
;; #2 purpose of dataset integration/manipulation
;; #3 sampling/temporal component of variables


;; Create metadata variable graph which provides an initial analysis
;; structure for recording results.
